# lingtypology
This library is a Python3 tool for linguistic interactive mapping.
It is based on R-package (https://github.com/ropensci/lingtypology) created by https://github.com/agricolamz.
It uses the same phylosophy and provides similar functionality.

Now it uses 1.2.1-146-gdff21a77e4.csv version of the Glottolog database by default.

The project is temporarily suspended until I pass through the exam session. I have a performance issue with maps when I draw many markers (>50). I tried using canvas instead of SVG but it did not help. If somebody knows leaflet and wants to help, that will be most appreciated.
