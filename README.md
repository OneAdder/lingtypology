# lingtypology
This library is a Python3 tool for linguistic interactive mapping.
It is based on R-package (https://github.com/ropensci/lingtypology) created by https://github.com/agricolamz.
It uses the same phylosophy and provides similar functionality.

Now it uses 1.2.1-146-gdff21a77e4.csv version of the Glottolog database by default.

I'm back in the game. The optimization issue somehow solved itself. So, I'm adding new language database APIs
